# LibraryManager
  This is a simple library manager that helps to create users ( using Firebase Authentication ) and then help to add books by the admin itself. These books can be viewed by the users and whenever the book is added to the list a notification pops up as a message. This app doesn't show the lime limit of the book to return as we thought it would. It is developed in the older version of the android studio.
